<p> 
The purpose of the workshop is to bring together researchers
interested in applying computational techniques to problems in
morphology, phonology, and phonetics. Work that addresses orthographic
issues is also welcome. Papers will be on substantial, original, and
unpublished research on these topics, potentially including strong
work in progress. Appropriate topics include (but are not limited to)
the following as they relate to the areas of the workshop:
</p>
<ul>
<li>New formalisms, computational treatments, or probabilistic models of existing linguistic formalisms 
<li>Unsupervised, semi-supervised or machine learning of linguistic knowledge 
<li>Models of psycholinguistic experiments 
<li>Morpheme identification and word segmentation 
<li>Algorithms, including finite-state methods 
<li>Corpus linguistics 
<li>Machine transliteration and back-transliteration 
<li>Speech technologies relating to phonetics or phonology 
<li>Speech science (both production and comprehension) 
<li>Analysis or exploitation of multilingual, multi-dialectal, or diachronic data 
<li>Instructional technologies for second-language learners 
<li>Integration of morphology, phonology, or phonetics with other NLP tasks 
<li>Tools and resources 
<li>Approaches to orthographic variation
<li>Approaches to universal morphological reinflection
</ul>

<p>
One of the missions of SIGMORPHON is to encourage interaction between
work in computational linguistics and work in theoretical phonetics,
phonology and morphology, and to ensure that each of these fields
profits from the interaction. Our recent meetings have been successful
in this regard, and we hope to see this continue in 2018. Many
mainstream linguists studying phonetics, phonology and morphology are
employing computational tools and models that are of considerable
interest to computational linguists. Similarly, models and tools
developed by and for computational linguists may be of interest to
theoretical linguists working in these areas. This workshop provides a
forum for these researchers to interact and become exposed to each
others' ideas and research.

<h3>Important Dates</h3>

<ul>
<li><b> TBA </b> Paper submission deadline
<li><b> TBA </b> Notification of acceptance
<li><b> TBA</b> Camera-ready papers due
<li><b>31 October, 2018:</b> Workshop
</ul>

<h3>Paper Submission</h3>

<p>
<b>Content:</b> Long papers should be original, topical, and
clear. Completed work is preferable to intended work, but in any event
the paper should clearly indicate the state of completion of the
reported results. We also encourage short submissions, which can cover
research, or can describe important problems (new or old).
</p>

<p>
<b>Submission Format:</b> The only accepted format for submitted
papers is Adobe PDF. Submissions should be anonymous, without authors
or an acknowledgement section; self-citations should appear in third
person. Submissions should follow the two-column format of EMNLP 
proceedings, and long papers should not exceed eight (8) pages, short
papers should not exceed four (4) pages. One additional page is
allowed for the References section in both cases.  However, all
material other than the bibliography must fall within the first 8/4
pages! We strongly recommend the use of the LaTeX style files or
Microsoft Word document template that will available on the EMNLP 
conference web site. We reserve the right to reject submissions that
do not conform to these styles, including font size restrictions.

<h3 id="important-new-submission-guidelines">IMPORTANT: New submission guidelines</h3>
<p>EMNLP 2018 adopts ACL’s <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/portal/content/new-policies-submission-review-and-citation">new policies for submission, review, and citation</a>. Submissions that violate any of these policies will be rejected without review. Most importantly, the policies refer to the anonymity period, which starts on TBA, 2018 for SIGMORPHON 2018.</p>

<h2>Shared Task: Morphological Reinflection</h2>

<p>Main site: <a href="sigmorphon.org">sigmorphon.org</a></p>

<p>
Morphological analysis and generation of previously unseen word forms
is a fundamental problem in NLP the accuracy of which is crucial for
the success of many downstream tasks.  Learning morphological
inflection patterns from labeled data is a current challenge that is
addressed by a number of papers published in various ACL-related
venues. To bring together researchers working on inference problems
related to morphology, SIGMORPHON and CONLL are co-hosting a shared task on
universal morphological reinflection in 2016, held at EMNLP in Brussels, Belgium.
</p>

<p>
The shared task will consist of two tasks.  Following successful shared tasks
in inflection generation in 2016 and 2017, the first task will involve 
type-level inflection.  
Participants will build systems that can learn to inflect words
given a lemma and morphological feature set.
For example, the present participle of the verb "read" is
"reading".  This task expands on previous tasks, with the 
largest variety of languages yet!

The second task will, for the first time, ask participants to
produce systems that can inflect a lemma in context.
This task will be a traditional cloze task, where an indicated
lemma in context must be inflected correctly.  The task
will consist of two tracks: in the first, the lemmas and 
morphological features of context words are provided; in the
second, the inflected words are the only contextual cues.

</p>

<p>
Participants will also be invited to describe their system in a short
paper for the SIGMORPHON 2018 workshop. The task organizers will write
an overview paper with descriptions and summaries of the different
approaches taken and their results.
</p>

information about the task, including training and development data
sets for the target languages of varying morphological complexity is
available at the shared task home page.
